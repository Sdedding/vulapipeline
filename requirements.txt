# PyGObject
# FIXME: we need pygobject (python3-gi in debuntu) but having it here makes
# setuptools try to build cairo too, which has more build deps... there are
# instructions here for how to pip install pygobject without cairo, but it is
# unclear how we can apply that to make vula pip installable:
#   https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject/-/issues/395
# Having python3-gi installed while having PyGObject in the requirements file
# makes the PYGOBJECT_WITHOUT_PYCAIRO approach documented above not work -
# setup.py install will try to compile pycairo even though python3-gi is
# already installed. So, for now, we leave PyGObject commented out here.
