Description: Automatic local network encryption
 # vula: automatic local network encryption
 .
 With zero configuration, vula automatically encrypts IP communication between
 hosts on a local area network in a forward-secret and transitionally
 post-quantum manner to protect against passive eavesdropping.
 .
 With manual key verification and/or automatic key pinning and manual resolution
 of IP or hostname conflicts, vula will additionally protect against
 interception by active adversaries.
 .
 When the local gateway to the internet is also vula peer, internet-destined
 traffic will also be encrypted on the LAN.
 .
 ### How does it work?
 .
 Automatically.
 .
 Vula combines [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf) for
 forward-secret point-to-point tunnels with
 [mDNS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) and
