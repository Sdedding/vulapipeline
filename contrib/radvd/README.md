Vula peers may optionally act as a gateway that announces or assigns IPv4 or
IPv6 prefixes.  One option for publishing an IPv6 prefix is to use `radvd` for
prefix announcement. The `radvd` package on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu may be
configured using the example `radvd.conf` configuration file for publishing a
vula compatible ULA to the local-area network.
